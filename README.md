# Catalog_Controller_CheatScript
I got lazy with re-typing and replacing values in a catalog controller, so I scripted it so it could be copy and pasted from certain values.

## Warning:  
This doesn't follow great convention, this documentation is taking longer than it took to write the entire script.  It is not tested, and is for a very minimal secular use.
